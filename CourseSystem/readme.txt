Hello!

Welcome to the Course System readme! The Course System is the menu driven interface that is used to navigate content
on appinventor.org. 

This readme will tell you what goes where in the CourseSystem folder and where to find things.


Content_Pages - Put html files of content here. In the editor when you make a new content item just specify the path 
				to the html file. 
				You could technically put your content html file anywhere in the appinventor directory as long as you
				specify the correct path and configure the app.yaml accordingly, but that's really messy. 
				SO PLEASE! just put them in the Content_Pages 
				folder.
				
				Example: 
							You put the html file with the content you want inside the Content_Pages folder
							and called it dopecontent.html
							On the content editor page in the path field you put:
							/CourseSystem/Content_Pages/dopecontent.html
