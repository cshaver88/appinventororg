<h1>How do you record information in a list?</h1>
<h2>How do you record notes input by the user?</h2>

          <p>
			This behavior illustrates the basics of a note taking or twitter-like app. You first define a variable “noteList” and initialize it to the create empty list block. This marks the variable noteList as a list so you can put items into it.
		  </p> 
		</br>
		<p>When the user enters a note in the NoteTextBox and clicks “Submit”, add items to list is called to append the user’s entry to the end of the list. noteList is then set into ListLabel.Text to display it to the user, and the user’s entry in NoteTextBox is blanked out to ready it for the next entry.</p>
	</br>
	<p>Note: this data in this sample is not persistent, meaning the notes entered by the user will only be recorded for the current run of the app. If you stopped the app and re-opened it, the notes list would be empty. To learn how to record data persistently, see xyz</p>

		   <p>
			This app is great for contests. You ask your audience to text you, then you click a button to pick a winner and the winner’s phone rings! 
			</p>
		</br>
		<p>You first define a variable “incomingTexts” and initialize it to the create empty list block. This marks the variable as a list so you can put items into it.</p>
		</br>
		<p>When a text comes in, Texting.MessageReceived is triggered. The app first checks to make sure the number isn’t already in the list. If it is not, the number is added to the list.</p>
		</br>
		<p>When ready, the user can click the PickWinnerButton.Click button. In that event-handler, pick a random item is called to to grab a lucky winner and a PhoneCall component is used to call the number.</p>

		<p>
			This app has two components, an AccelerometerSensor and a TextToSpeech. When the user shakes the phone or tablet, the AccelerometerSensor senses the event and the when <span class="empfront">AccelerometerSensor1.Shaking</span> event handler is triggered. The TextToSpeech component is called to carry out the response of speaking the words “I’m shaking”.
