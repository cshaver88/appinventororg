		  <h3>Example 1. How do you create a drawing canvas?</h3>
		    <img class="thumbnail" src="../../assets/img/Drawing/canvas.png" border="0"/>
		   <p>
			The <span class="empfont">Canvas</span> component is a sub-panel within your app. Canvases are used for
			drawing and animation-- your app can draw objects, and you can give the user
			the capability to draw objects.
			</p>
			<p>
			Typically, you want your canvas to fill the entire width of the app screen, so
			you'll set the Width to Fill Parent" as in the blocks above. Generally you
			want to have other components above or below, so you'll set the Height to some
			fixed number.
			</p>
			<p>A location of an object on the canvas is defined with an X,Y value relative
			to the canvas's left-top corner. <span class="empfont">X</span> is
			the horizontal location of the object, 0 being the left-border and <span class="empfont">X</span> getting
			bigger as an object is moved to the right. <span class="empfont">Y</span> is the vertical location with
			0 the top border and <span class="empfont">Y</span> getting bigger as an object is moved down.

			<h3>Example 2. How do draw a circle at 10,10?</h3>
			<img class="thumbnail" src="../../assets/img/Drawing/circle1010.png" border="0"/>
			<p>
			Canvas has function blocks for drawing a circle or line. The DrawCircle has
			three parameters, <span class="empfont">x</span>, <span class="empfont">y</span>, and 
			<span class="empfont">radius</span>. <span class="empfont">x</span> is the horizontal location, 
			<span class="empfont">y</span> is the vertical
			location, and <span class="empfont">r</span> is the radius of the circle to be drawn. An x-value of 10 means the
			circle will be located 10 pixels to the right of the left border of the canvas. A y-value
			of 10 means the circle is located 10 pixels down from the top of the canvas.

          <div class="span6">	
			<a name="canvasMiddle"></a> 
		
		  <h3>Example 3. How do you move an image to the middle of the canvas?</h3> 
		
		<img class="thumbnail" src="../../assets/img/Drawing/canvasMiddle.png" border="0"/>
		
		 <p>
		 The blocks in the sample locate <span class="empfont">x</span>ImageSprite1</span> in the middle of the canvas using
		 the <span class="empfont">x</span>Width</span> and <span class="empfont">x</span>Height</span> properties. Such abstract references mean the code will
		 work even if the Canvas is resized. Alternatively, you could place fixed numbers in
		 for the X and Y of the MoveTo (similarly to how 10,10 was used in the above example. Do you know why 1/2 the width and height
		 of the sprite is subtracted?
		 <p> 	
		 <p>Note that there is no "DrawImage" block like <span class="empfont">x</span>DrawCircle</span>. Instead, with 
		 the designer you drag <span class="empfont">x</span>ImageSprite</span> components into
		a <span class="empfont">x</span>Canvas</span> and specify the image file (picture) that defines their appearance. There is no
		way to dynamically create sprites with blocks, you can only make them (in-)visible
		and locate them as in this example.
