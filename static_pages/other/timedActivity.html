<title>Timed Activity</title>
  
<h2>Timed Activity: How do you repeat an action, pausing between each iteration?</h2>
          <p>
			How do you program time? How do you program animation? With many programming 
			languages, concepts like animation are pushed back in the curriculum-- you might
			 not get there until a year or two of coursework. With App Inventor’s event-based approach,
			you can explore timed activity and animation as a beginner. The high-level Clock component 
			serves as an alarm clock, and you use its Timer event to trigger timed activity.
			 Check out the following examples:

		  <h3>Example 1. How do you play a sound every second?</h3>
		    <img class="thumbnail" src="../../assets/img/TimedActivity/timedSound.png" border="0"/>
		   <p>
			When the <span class="empfont">Clock.Timer</span> event is triggered repeatedly. Think of it like an alarm clock. 
			The <span class="empfont">Clock.TimerInterval</span> property, determines how often the sound will play. 
			By default it is 1000 milliseconds (1 second), so if you don’t change it the 
			sound above will play every second. You can set this property in the designer or 
			with blocks.

		  <h3>Example 2. How do you play a sound every 5 seconds?</h3>
		  <p><span class="empfont">The Clock.TimerInterval</span> property determines how often the <span class="empfont">Clock.Timer</span> event triggers. 
         By default, the timer interval is set to 1000 ms, or 1 second. If you set it to 5000, 
         the <span class="empfont">Clock.Timer</span> event will trigger every 5 seconds. 
         <img class="thumbnail" src="../../assets/img/TimedActivity/setInterval5000.png" border="0"/>
         It is a bit confusing and indirect, because you typically set the <span class="empfont">TimerInterval</span> 
         in the Designer, and the <span class="empfont">when Clock.Timer event</span> is in the blocks editor. 
         But just realize that the timer will be triggered every “TimerInterval” milliseconds.</p>

			<h3>Example 3. How do you move a spaceship smoothly across the screen?</h3>
			<img class="thumbnail" src="../../assets/img/TimedActivity/spaceshipmove.png" border="0"/>
			<p>
			The spaceship’s <span class="empfont">X</span> coordinate defines its horizontal location. On each timer 
			event, the <span class="empfont">X</span> coordinate is increased and the spaceship appears further to the right. 
			If the <span class="empfont">Clock.TimerInterval</span> property is set to the default of 1000 ms, then the ship 
			will move every one second, a very choppy motion. Typically, for this type of 
			animation, you’ll set the timer interval to something like 40 ms.

		 <h3>Example 4. A "moving picture" is really a sequence of pictures displayed very fast. 
		 The frame rate of a moving picture is the number of pictures (frames) shown every 
		 second. If you set the timer interval for the spaceship to 40 ms, what will be 
		 the frame rate for your “movie”? What is the typical frame rate for a movie you see 
		 at the theater?</h3>
		 <img class="thumbnail" src="../../assets/img/TimedActivity/spaceshipmove.png" border="0"/>
		 <p>If the timer interval is set to 40 ms, the object will move every 40 ms. 
		 So each frame-- each new picture with the spaceship in a different location-- 
		 will appear for 40 ms. Frames per second is the number of frames that will 
		 appear in one second (1000 ms). Since each frame is 40 ms long, you’ll end up 
		 with 1000/40=25 frames per second.
		 </p>
		 <p>The standard frame rate for the film industry is 24 frames per second, 
		 see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate</a> for details.</p>

		  <h2>How do you start and stop an animation?</h2>
		  <p>Just as you can turn an alarm clock on and off, you can turn the 
		  Clock component’s timer on and off. Check out the following examples:</p>
		
		  <h3>Example 1. When the user clicks a start button, start playing a sound every 
		second. When they click a stop button, stop playing the sound.</h3>
		<img class="thumbnail" src="../../assets/img/TimedActivity/startStopButton.png" border="0"/>
		<p>The clock has a <span class="empfont">Clock.TimerEnabled</span> property. When it is true, the alarm clock 
		is on so the timer will trigger. When <span class="empfont">Clock.TimerEnabled</span> is set to false the timer 
		is dormant. </p>

		<p>When the user clicks the start button, TimerEnabled is set to true to get things
		 moving. A second later, and each second thereafter, the when <span class="empfont">Clock.Timer</span> event 
		 will trigger and the sound will play. When the user clicks “Stop”, the timer is 
		 disabled and the sound stops playing.</p>

		 <h3>Example 2. When the user speaks, start the spaceship moving. When the 
		 user shakes the phone, stop the spaceship from moving.</h3>
		 <img class="thumbnail" src="../../assets/img/TimedActivity/shakeSpeak.png" border="0"/>
		<p> 
		You need two additional components, a <span class="empfont">SpeechRecognizer</span> that can recognize when the 
		user is speaking, and an AccelerometerSensor that senses when the device is being shook.
        </p>
        <p>
		The <span class="empfont">Screen.Initialize</span> event handler is triggered when the app begins. The 
		<span class="empfont">SpeechRecognizer.GetText</span> block opens the speech recognizer so that it 
		is waiting for the user to say something. When the user speaks, the 
		<span class="empfont">SpeechRecognizer.AfterGettingText</span> event handler is triggered. Here, you set 
		<span class="empfont">Clock.TimerEnabled</span> to true so the clock timer will start triggering and the sprite 
		will begin moving. When the user shakes the phone, <span class="empfont">AccelerometerSensor.Shaking</span> is 
		triggered, the timer is disabled so the sprite stops, and the <span class="empfont">SpeechRecognizer.GetText</span> 
		is called to await the next time the user speaks.
