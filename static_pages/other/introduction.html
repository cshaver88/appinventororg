            <p>
                App Inventor is a visual "blocks" language with a drag-and-drop interface. Here are some
                of the reasons that even non-technical people can program with it:
            </p>


            <ul class="lead" style="font-size: 14px;">
		 <li> <i>Its like doing a puzzle</i> -- instead of writing code, you assemble puzzle pieces.</li>
                <li> <i>No syntax</i> -- The blocks language eliminates the need to remember and type code.</li>
                <li> <i>Everything is right in front of you</i> -- The components and functions are organized into
                    drawers. Just find, drag, and drop.
                </li>
                <li> <i>An app is a set of event-handlers</i> -- You program by specifying "When this happens, the app does this"
                </li>
                <li> <i>High-level components</i> -- Blocks or not, you can make use of the Google App Inventor team's carefully designed Android code library                </li>
                <li> <i>Only some blocks plug-in</i> -- Instead of chastising you, App Inventor only allows things that make sense.</li>
                <li> <i>Concreteness</i> -- The language is designed for working with concrete objects, not abstractions</li>
            </ul>

        <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#intro-can-do"><h2>What you can create with App Inventor?</h2></a>

        <div id="intro-can-do" class="collapse">

            <p>
                App Inventor allows you to create Android applications
                without writing program code. Instead of writing code,
                you visually design the way the app
                looks and then specify its behavior by configuring
                blocks. The app
                inventor team has created blocks for just about
                everything you can do
                with an Android phone (text, GPS, etc.), as well as blocks for doing normal
                "programming" stuff-- variables for
                remembering things, foreach and while blocks for
                repeating operations, and conditional (if) blocks so
                that your app can ask questions and branch based on the
                answers. There's even blocks to store information in a
                database and talk to web services like Twitter.
                <br/><br/>You can build just about any app imaginable
                with App Inventor: games, informational apps with
                user-generated data, personal convenience apps, apps to
                help people communicate, apps that make use of the
                phone's sensors, and even apps that talk to web services
                like Twitter. Instead of being stuck with the apps on
                your phone or in the Android Market, you can make your
                own. You can build apps just for your own personal use,
                or implement/prototype that killer app idea that you
                can't get out of your mind.<br/><br/>One way to begin
                with App Inventor is by building games. Within a few
                hours, you can build games like MoleMash,
                Tic-Tac-Toe, Pong, or a game that let's you draw funny
                pictures on your sibling's face. You can even make use
                of the phone's orientation sensor and build a game that
                moves a ball through a maze as the player tilts the
                phone.<br/><br/>But App Inventor is not just is for
                bulding games. You can use also use it to build
                educational software. You
                can create a quiz app to help you and your classmates
                study for a test, or a <i>Math Blaster </i>app for your
                little sister to work on her multiplication tables. You
                can add all the bells and whistles you want to these
                quizzes-- you can use the Music Player Component to
                create a <i>Name That Tune</i> app, or the Video
                Component to create a quiz showing clips of your
                favorite movies. With the TextToSpeech component, you
                might even have the phone ask the questions or report
                the answers aloud.<br/><br/>The apps you build need not
                be based on fixed data, but can instead store <i>user-generated</i>
                data in a database. So you can create a workout app that
                lets the user enter how many crunches he does each day,
                or modify a quiz app so that new quizzes can be created
                on the fly. <br/><br/>Because App Inventor provides
                access to a GPS-location sensor, you can also build <i>location-aware</i>
                apps. You can build an app to help you remember where
                you parked your car, an app that shows the location of
                your friends or colleagues at a concert or conference,
                or your own <i>custom tour</i> app of your school,
                workplace, or a museum.<br/><br/>You can also write apps
                that use the phone functionality of an Android device.
                You can write an app that periodically texts "missing
                you" to your loved one(s), or an app "No Text While
                Driving" that responds to all texts automatically with
                "sorry, I'm driving and will contact you later". You can
                even have the app read the incoming texts aloud to you
                (though this might lure you into responding).<br/><br/>Finally,
                App Inventor provides components that allow apps to
                communicate with the web. There's a Twitter component,
                so if you don't like your phone's Twitter client, you
                can write your own. The TinyWebDB component also
                provides a more general component for communicating with
                web services, so if you know how to write web apps, or
                you can collaborate with someone that does, you can use
                App Inventor to write Android front-ends that talk to
                your favorite web sites. For instance, you could have a
                programmer-friend write an AppInventor-compliant web
                service for accessing Amazon data, and you could write a
                custom bookstore browsing app that let's you see the
                price of a book at Amazon.<br/><br/>You can't build any
                app with App Inventor-- the tool provides a limited
                number of high-level components and does not provide
                access to all of the functionality defined in the
                Android feature set (which is accessible through the
                Java programming system development kit (Android SDK)).
                But you can build many apps with just the tool, and
                theTinyWebDB component provides a bridge to more complex
                computational elements and web services, so App Inventor
                can be used in collaboration with "back-end"
                programmers.

                    <h3>Can you use App Inventor with the Android Emulator?</h3>

                    <p>You can develop apps without a phone just using  the emulator that comes with the App Inventor starter software you download                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Can you share project code with other App Inventor users?</h3>

                    <p>Yes. To share a project, go to the My Projects page, select a project, then choose More Actions |
                        Download Source. This will create a zip
                        file
                        which you can share with others.
                        To upload a project, go to My Projects, choose More Actions | Upload Source, and choose a zip
                        file previously downloaded from App
                        Inventor.</p>

                    <p>Note that the source code (.zip) files are not executable Android programs (.apk
                        files).
                        The source code is also not Java SDK code-- it can only be loaded into App Inventor.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Can you prototype with App Inventor then generate Java SDK code to work at a lower-level?</h3>

                    <p>At this time, App Inventor does not generate Java SDK code. You can download source code from the
                        My Projects page, but this source code can
                        only
                        be uploaded back into another App Inventor environment. The source code generated is not Java
                        SDK code.</p>

                    <p>You can, however, connect to back-end code through the TinyWebDB component or through the Web
                        component.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3>Can you connect to web services from an app written in App Inventor?</h3>

                    <p>You can connect from App Inventor apps to the web using the TinyWebDB component or through the
                        Web component. The TinyWebDB component can
                        communicate with any service that conforms to a particular protocol. At USF, we've written
                        Android apps that talk to Amazon, San Francisco's
                        NextMuni API for getting transit information, and Yahoo finance. Here are some links to
                        help:</p>

                    <h3>Is App Inventor only a toy language? Can you build sophisticated apps with it?</h3>

                    <p>Though App Inventor has limitations, it can be used to build complex apps. The language provides
                        programming constructs like foreach, while,
                        and
                        if-else, in visual (block) form. The App Inventor team has built high-level components and
                        operations (blocks) for much of the Android
                        functionality, though not all of it. There are mechanisms for communicating with web services
                        and databases.</p>

                    <p>There is also a component development kit on the roadmap. This will allow programmers to build
                        App Inventor components with Java and
                        essentially
                        eliminate any limitations that App Inventor has.</p>

                    <h3>Is it possible to bring in multiple authors on a single project?</h3>

                    <p>No. As of now, the only way to work together is to share source code. On the projects page, you
                        download source and send the zip file to your
                        colleague, who can then upload the source. Sharing as can be done with Google Docs will be added
                        eventually.</p>

                    <h3>Can you build multi-screen apps with App Inventor?</h3>

                    <p>Multi-screen support has been added to App Inventor.</p>

                    <p>It is possible to create an app that shows the phone's current location in Maps. There is a
                        component called WebViewer that lets you show any
                        URL, including Maps, from your app. You can set with text that incorporates your current
                        location, e.g.,

                        geo:0.323243,-0.112444</p>
