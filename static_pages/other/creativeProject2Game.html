<h1>Creative Project 2: Game </h1>

<p>
Create an app with animation behavior similar to that found in MoleMash and Pong. Functionally, the app should have the following:
<ul>
<li>objects that move over time (e.g., a spaceship flying across the screen)</li>
<li>objects which are transformed in reaction to end-user activities (e.g., OrientationSensor to control movement) </li>
<li>objects that (dis-)appear in reaction to end-user activities (e.g., an asteroid disappearing when shot)</li>
<li>use of conditional (if) blocks</li>
<li>use of collidedWith and edgeReached blocks</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Be creative-- you need not build a shooter game or even a game at all, as long as your app exhibits the animated behaviors listed above. Run your idea by your instructor to make sure it meets the complexity requirement.
