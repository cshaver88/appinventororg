<H1>Creative Project 1: Soundboard App</H1>

<p>
Working in teams of two, build a "mediaboard" app of your choosing. A mediaboard app displays some image buttons. When each button is clicked, some media is played. The app can be about almost anything, but it must have:</p>
<ul><li>A complex user interface arrangement, using a TableArrangement and/or Vertical and HorizontalArrangement components.</li>
<li>At least four different media played in response to different events (e.g., button clicks).</li>
<li>Some decision-making (an if-block).
</li></ul>
<h3>Ideas</h3>
<p>Here are some ideas to get you thinking?</p>
<ul><li>A soundboard playing notes from your favorite songs or favorite people and speeches.</li>
<li>Educational software for kids, e.g., farm animal app</li>
<li>A <i>name that tune</i> game that plays song notes and displays the song name (answer) after the user clicks a button.</li>

<li>An app that does different things when it receives a text from another phone.</li>
<li>An app about your school/organization providing info about different places on campus.</li>
<li>An app that lets you click on pics of your classmates to see their name and hear their voice.<br>
</li>
<li>Anything you can think of-- just run it by your instructor</li></ul>
<b>Deliverables</b><br>
<p>Create a single app page on one of the team member's portfolios. The other team member should link to the teammate's page. Follow the <a href="/appPage">instructions</a> for creating an app page</a>. </p>
