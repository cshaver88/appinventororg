High schools will soon be teaching <strong>AP Computer Science Principles</strong>, a much more accessible introduction
to computer science than the current Java curriculum. This is great news, and <strong>Ralph Morelli</strong> has
developed an<a href="http://mobile-csp.org/"> AP CSP course</a> that uses App Inventor as the programming language! Check out his curriculum which
has been successfully taught by high school teachers who are not formerly trained in 
Computer Science or Math. An on-line version of the course is coming soon!.

A course <strong>that puts Design and CS students</strong> in the same room, build apps and learning how talk to each other? Does this exist?
Yes, it does. Check out this innovative <a href="http://appdesignf13.wiki.uml.edu/">UMass-Lowell course</a>
which put designers and CS majors in the same room, and which was co-taught by a Design CS professors
<strong>Karen Roehr</strong> and <strong>Fred Martin</strong>. Our universities need more of these collaborations!
