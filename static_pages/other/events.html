<h2>How do you program an app’s behavior?</h2>
          <p>
			Think of an app like an event-response machine. The user clicks a button, the app responds. A text comes in, the app sends an auto-reply. A flying saucer hits an asteroid, it blows up. Your job as a programmer is to program such event-responses. In App Inventor, you do this directly-- your code is essentially a set of event-responses. Check out the following samples:
		  </p> 
       <div class="row-fluid">
       	<div class="span6">
       	<a name="timedSound"></a> 
		  <h3>How do you turn a button red when the user clicks it?</h3>
		    <img class="thumbnail" src="../../assets/img/TimedActivity/timedSound.png" border="0"/>
		   <p>
			OK, this is a really dumb app but it will get us started. The app appears and there is a gray button. When the user touches (clicks) the button, you button changes to red.
			The click of the button, <span class="empfont">Button1.Click</span>, is an event, something that can happen to the app. The gold when <span class="empfont">Button1.Click</span> block is called an event-handler. The blocks inside it are the response to the event. set means to change something, in this case, change the button’s BackgroundColor to red. The blocks, as a whole, specify that when the user clicks the button it should turn red.

		<h3>When the user shakes the phone, say ‘I’m shaking”</h3>

		<p>
			This app has two components, an AccelerometerSensor and a TextToSpeech. When the user shakes the phone or tablet, the AccelerometerSensor senses the event and the when <span class="empfront">AccelerometerSensor1.Shaking</span> event handler is triggered. The TextToSpeech component is called to carry out the response of speaking the words “I’m shaking”.
